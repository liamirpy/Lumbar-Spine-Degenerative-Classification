# Data Spliting

After the previous part that we create a single csv file that includes all the data that we want to use it, 
now we want to splitted this data to seperated csv file for each condition. (The left and right condition are in same group)


At the final we have three csv file:


- Neural_Foraminal_Narrowing.csv
- Subarticular_Stenosis.csv 
- Spinal_Canal_Stenosis.csv


The code for this purpose are available in directory [Data_splitting](./Data_splitting/)directory.
