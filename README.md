# Lumbar-Spine-Degenerative-Classification

This repository focuses on developing models for the detection and classification of degenerative spine conditions using lumbar spine MR images.

he aim is to simulate a radiologist's diagnostic process, helping to identify and assess the severity of conditions such as neural foraminal narrowing, subarticular stenosis, and spinal canal stenosis. This project is part of a competition to build models that enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing these spine conditions
